      "about_company": "Manis Grafika specializes in producing elegant, high-quality prayer books. Renowned for its commitment to beauty and tradition, Manis Grafika combines artistic values with high production quality.",
      "challenge": "Before having a website, Manis Grafika relied solely on word-of-mouth, printed catalogs, and direct communication through messaging apps to showcase their products and handle customer orders. This manual process not only limited their digital presence but also made it difficult for potential customers to browse product variations efficiently. The lack of an online platform also affected the brand’s perceived professionalism in an increasingly digital market.",
      "solution":"To address the challenge, I designed a responsive website that balances luxurious visual elements with functional simplicity. The homepage welcomes users with a polished hero section showcasing premium products and key messaging. Below it, a well-organized catalog section allows users to scroll through featured designs with ease. I chose a soft, neutral color palette and elegant typefaces to reflect the brand’s spiritual tone, while ensuring readability and mobile responsiveness. A dedicated contact section streamlines communication and encourages inquiries. Overall, the solution delivers a refined yet accessible user experience that elevates Manis Grafika’s digital presence.",
      "goals": "The primary goal was to create a modern, elegant company profile website that highlights the variety and quality of Manis Grafika’s offerings while enhancing trust and ease of access for customers. The site needed to serve as a digital catalog, helping visitors explore book design options visually, understand the company’s service scope, and initiate orders seamlessly.",

It offers a calm and strategic learning experience for beginners and experienced investors alike, featuring curated programs, insightful articles, and community-driven content. With a rapidly growing audience, The Investor aims to build a strong brand presence as a trusted source of financial education in Indonesia.",
      "challenge": "Despite having a solid program and strong community engagement, The Investor lacked a website that reflected its brand personality and professionalism. Their online presence was fragmented, and potential users didn’t have a single place to clearly understand what the platform stood for. The main challenge was to create a website that could consolidate brand identity while remaining simple, modern, and inviting to its audience",
      "solution":"To meet these goals, I designed a refined and responsive website that delivers a focused experience, both visually and structurally. The homepage introduces the brand with a bold headline and minimal aesthetic, followed by concise sections that explain the brand story, what it offers, and how users can engage. Neutral colors, clean typography, and deliberate spacing were used to convey professionalism and trust. The structure leads users naturally toward a call-to-action, encouraging further interaction. The website is fully optimized for mobile, ensuring consistent accessibility across all devices.",
      "goals": "The project’s main objective was to create a company profile website that represents The Investor’s credibility, focus, and clarity.

The site also needed to guide visitors toward further exploration — whether that meant reading educational content, exploring programs, or joining the community.",
