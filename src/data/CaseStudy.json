      "about_company": "Manis Grafika is a professional book publisher and printing service based in Solo, Indonesia, specializing in religious books such as Yasin and Tahlil. They are known for producing high-quality, aesthetically pleasing prayer books using premium materials.",
      "challenge": "Manis Grafika initially had a static and outdated landing page that failed to represent the premium quality of their products. Even though they actively sold on Shopee, Tokopedia, and promoted via Instagram and Facebook, the existing website did not support or reflect their brand’s luxurious image.",
      "goals": [
        "Redesign the website to make it look more luxurious and elegant, aligning with the product’s character.",
        "Present a digital catalog that is minimalist, clean, and easy to browse.",
        "Enhance brand credibility through a more professional digital appearance."
      ],
      "solution" : "To address the problem, I conducted visual research on several luxury brands including Bottega Veneta, Burberry, Chanel, Chloé, and Christian Dior. These websites typically use clean white backgrounds, minimalist layouts, and focus heavily on high-quality product imagery. \n Inspired by these elements, I redesigned Manis Grafika’s website to be clean, elegant, and product-centric. The main highlight of the new design is large product photos that emphasize the premium feel of their offerings.",
